                                           Press Enter/Return to Continue...                                           



Please type subject initials and press return. qqq
Do you want to run the occluded or unoccluded version? Type "occ" for occluded, "nocc" for unoccluded, or "both" for both. Then press return.  both
 
Specify which parameters you want to be included/varied (Luminance, Texture, Common Region, or some combo)
To do so, enter a string containing only L, T, C, or some combo of these characters: L
L = 1
T = 0
C = 0
 
Do you want to run practice trials before the experiment? Press "y" for yes or "n" for no. Then press return.  y
 
We found 1 folders with _cmpltd in the name.
Entering the most recent quest output directory.. 
We found 1 file with .mat in the name. 
Loading in Data from the Most Recent QUEST Session.. 
We found 1 psychometric function fit from the previous QUEST session. 
Using the threshold values from this function to determine the QUEST starting parameters for this session.. 
Below are the threshold estimates of the 3 interleaved QUEST thresholds from the last session:
thr1 (0.65): 107.3642
thr2 (0.75): 164.0015
thr3 (0.85): 250.5164
The total number of blocks/QUEST session repetitions is curently set to 3.
 If that looks OK, type 'y' and press return. If not, type 'n' and then press return.  y


----- ! PTB - ERROR: SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE ! -----

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!
Please read 'help SyncTrouble' for information about how to solve or work-around the problem.
You can force Psychtoolbox to continue, despite the severe problems, by adding the command
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script, if you really know what you are doing.


We found 936 files ...
 
usedNoise.mat found. Reading in list of noise images used in previous sessions and removing them from the list for this session..
